	<h2>The Bahamas</h2>
	<h3>What are The Bahamas</h3>
	<p>The Bahamas, officially the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is an island country within the Lucayan Archipelago of the Atlantic Ocean. It contains 97% of the Lucayan Archipelago's land area and 88% of its population. The archipelagic country consists of more than 3,000 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of Cuba and northwest of the island of Hispaniola (split between the Dominican Republic and Haiti) and the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the U.S. state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys.</p>  
	<h3>Why do you want to go to the Bahamas?</h2>
	<p>Apart from stunning beaches and breathtaking views, a top-teir food experience was key to me while making the decision for my dream vacation. This is something that the Bahamas has, and when paired with other sightseeing and relaxing activities the country has to offer, it easily became a no-brainer on my dream vacation list.</p>
